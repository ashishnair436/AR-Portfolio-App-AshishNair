# AR-Portfolio-App-AshishNair

This is a Augmented Reality (AR) App created for Android using Unity Engine and Vuforia . In this app when the image target is scanned , my real-life looking 3D model appears along with information and many buttons for my social media handles like Linkedin, Instagram, Discord, Github and Whatsapp . Along with links for the games that I have created with brief description about them and also my resume. If you would like to test it out for yourself I am attaching links for google drive for the apk and links here. I hope you like the app. Thank you
